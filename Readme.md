# 🧠ChatClub – Learn English Through Daily Conversations

🚧 **Project is currently under active development.**

**ChatClub** is a smart, chat-based English learning platform built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), **Socket.io**, and powered by **Gemini AI** and **Google Translate**.  
It helps users improve their English naturally by chatting in Hinglish with friends and seeing real-time English translations — just like chatting on WhatsApp or Telegram, but with built-in English learning!

## 🎯 Project Goal

ChatClub aims to **teach English through your daily Hinglish chats** — no boring lectures, just natural chatting and smart learning.

## 💡 How It Works

- 🗨️ **User chats with friends in Hinglish**
- 📜 Each message is **instantly translated into English** (smartly + formally)
- 🔄 Both versions (Hinglish + English) are visible during chat
- 🧠 Over time, user naturally **remembers English phrases**
- 🗣️ Chat messages can be **replayed as voice** (AI roleplay with friend-style voice)
- 📚 Important chats can be saved as **roleplay conversations**
- 🧾 Users can **summarize any chat** and extract key **vocabulary words**
- 📕 Vocabulary is saved in a **personal vocabulary bank** (with Hindi meanings)
